# Secure-Enterprise-Network-Design
Secure Enterprise Network Design with Fortinet, Cisco, and Windows AD Integration.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure enterprise network using:
- Fortinet FortiGate for firewall policies, VPN, and content inspection.
- Cisco Layer 2/3 devices for VLAN segmentation and routing.
- Windows Active Directory for centralised user authentication.

## Objectives
- Create segmented VLANs for Employees, Guests, and Management.
- Configure site-to-site IPsec VPN and SSL VPN for remote access.
- Integrate Windows AD with FortiGate for role-based access control.

## Technologies Used
- Fortinet FortiGate (FGT v7.x)
- Cisco IOS
- Windows Server 2022 (Active Directory)
- Simulation Tools: EVE-NG, Wireshark
